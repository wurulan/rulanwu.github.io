This meta-analytic study synthesizes research on the relationships between family literacy practices and language development outcomes in immigrant children. The research addresses gaps in understanding how heritage language exposure and family literacy involvement contribute to multilingual development.

**Research Questions:**
- How do family literacy practices correlate with language development in immigrant children?
- What factors moderate these relationships across different immigrant populations?
- What are the implications for teacher education and literacy instruction?

**Expected Impact:**
This work will inform evidence-based practices for supporting families and teachers working with immigrant children in multicultural contexts.
