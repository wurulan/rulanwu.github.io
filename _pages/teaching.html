  <h2>Teaching and Educational Experience</h2>
  <p>I have experience teaching Chinese language and culture to K-12 students, supporting graduate research, and assisting with teacher education initiatives. I believe in creating inclusive, culturally-responsive learning environments that support all students, particularly multilingual learners.</p>
