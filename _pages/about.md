## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Curriculum and Instruction at Texas A&M University, focusing on literacy education and teacher education. My research interests include heritage language learning and identity development, family literacy practices, content literacy instruction, and technology-enhanced language and literacy instruction.

My academic journey began in forestry and environmental studies in China, where I developed a passion for education. I completed my M.Ed. in Teaching Chinese as a Second or Other Language (TCSOL) at Sichuan University, with a focus on heritage language learning and identity development. Now, as a Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M, I am engaged in collaborative research exploring the intersections of language, literacy, and teacher education.

## Research Focus

I am currently involved in several research projects:
- **Aggie Teachers Trajectory**: Investigating teacher perspectives toward literacy education
- **Asian Americans' Motivation And Career Exploration**: Examining community language learning programs
- **Math Literacy in Teacher Education**: Conducting comparative analysis of mathematical application problems in US and Chinese textbooks
- **Cross-Linguistic Literacy & Cognition (CLIC)**: Research on heritage language development and identity
